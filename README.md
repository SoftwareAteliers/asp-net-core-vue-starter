# ASP.NET Core Vue Starter

The repository contains an ASP.&#8203;NET Core + Vue.js starter template. The template runs on ASP.NET Core 3.0 and is created by Vue CLI 4.0 with a new plugin based architecture allowing developers to interactively scaffold a new project with just a one command.

Original article how to create the starter template is available [here](https://medium.com/software-ateliers/asp-net-core-vue-template-with-custom-configuration-using-cli-3-0-8288e18ae80b).

## Getting started

There are two ways how to set up the project: one for people who want to create their own template and choose custom integrations and the other for developers who want to start with no configuration.

## Clone the starter with default configuration

* Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/SoftwareAteliers/asp-net-core-vue-starter`

or you can use .NET Core CLI templates:

* Install the template from NuGet repository: `dotnet new -i SoftwareAteliers.AspNetCoreVueStarter`

* Initialize the project: `dotnet new vue -o MyProject`

## (Optional) Scaffold Vue.js app with custom configuration

If you prefer to overwrite default Vue client app with custom settings, take the following steps:

* **Remove all the contents** of the folder /ClientApp
* Create a new Vue project by using Vue CLI: `vue create client-app` OR by using CLI graphical interface running `vue ui`

> Unfortunately Vue CLI does not allow us to set a project name by C# standards using Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case) naming convention, so let's initiate app inside of client-app folder and then move the content to ClientApp.

* **Move all the contents from the new folder /client-app to /ClientApp.**

Now application is ready to run.

## Run the application

You have three choices when it comes to how you prefer to run the app. You can either use the command line or the build-in run command.

### 1. Using the command line

* Run the .NET application using `dotnet run`

### 2. Using the built-in run command

* Run the application in VSCode or Visual Studio 2017 by hitting `F5`

> It will take some time during the first run to download all client side dependencies.

### 3. Using docker

* Run the following command in a cmd window to build the docker image:
`docker build -t <IMAGE_NAME> .`

* Run the application in a cmd window by this command:
`docker run -d -p 8080:80 <IMAGE_NAME>`

## View your application running

Browse to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) for ASP.&#8203;NET Core + Vue app or browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) for Vue app only.
